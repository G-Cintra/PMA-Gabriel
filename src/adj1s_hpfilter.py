    Code for "On adjusting the one-sided Hodrick-Prescott filter" (2020) 
    by Elias Wolf (FU-Berlin), Frieder Mokinski (Deutsche Bundesbank), and
    Yves SchÃ¼ler (Deutsche Bundesbank)
    
    Version date 2022/03/2
    If you encounter any bug, please mail Elias Wolf at e.wolf@fu-berlin.de
    
    This program estimates the cyclical component of the adjusted one-sided HP
    filter (HP-1s*) by estimating the two-sided HP filter (HP-2s) 
    on an expanding sample and keeping the last observation.
    
    For the exact references that are cited in this program, please see
    the paper.
    
          Input:    
                     y       - a Tx1 vector (y_1,...,y_T)', where T is the
                     number of observations. 
                         
                     lm_2  - a scalar. This is the value of the smoothing
                     parameter usually employed for the two-sided HP filter
                     (HP2s). This input is optional. The default is lm_2=1,600.

                     opt    - boolean. If opt=True, the adjustment parameters are
                     obtained through the optimization routine (computationally more intensive).
                     This input is optional. The default is opt=0 (computationally less intensive).
    
        Output:  
                     ycycle_adj  - a Tx1 array with the adjusted extracted cyclical component
                
                     lm_1        - a scalar. This is the adjusted value of the smoothing parameter used as an input to the one-sided HP filter
    
                     kappa       - a scalar. This is the mulitplicative scaling factor, with wich the cyclical component of the
                     one-sided HP filter is rescaled
    
       Example:
                     ycycle_adj, lm1, kappa=adj1s_hpfilter(y,1600)
                     yields a Tx1 array of the extracted cyclical component
                     using a smoothing parameter of 650 and scaling
                     parameter of size 1.1513 for the one-sided HP filter

        Define cost function for optimization routine calculating the squared
        distance between the PTF of the two sided and the one sided HP-Filter.
        For the PTF of the one-sided filter, the weights are calculated based 
        on the formula given by Hamilton (2018) and subsequnetly cast into the 
        fequency domain using the FFT. The PTF of the two-sided filter is 
        constructed using the closed form solution for large samples 
        given by King and Rebello (1993). To avoid problems related to small 
        sample sizes we use a sample size of T=1000.
